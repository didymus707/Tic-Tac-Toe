Got the link, starred and watching it.

If you don't want reviews on Github for this (as it is being done with
your other course) I could set at least a mailing list for you,
that would be private (or at least unlisted), if you want to do that.

When running `bundle install` I am getting the message:

```
Your Gemfile has no gem server sources. If you need gems that are not
already on your machine, add a
line like this to your Gemfile:
source 'https://rubygems.org'
Your bundle is locked to rubocop (0.79.0), but that version could not be
found in any of the sources
listed in your Gemfile. If you haven't changed sources, that means the
author of rubocop (0.79.0) has
removed it. You'll need to update your bundle to a version other than
rubocop (0.79.0) that hasn't been
removed in order to install.
```

I would recommend at least version `0.80`.

Also, research and find out if `Gemfile.lock` should be included in the
repository and why.  (It does change at times that can be problematic,
and there are reasons that Gemfile should specify things a bit more
explicitly)

Also, there really should be a source line for the Gemfile.

It is useful to know that you can do `bundle init` to create a skeleton
Gemfile that will have the required things.

Here is the RFC patch:

This will give a location for others to install, and is not so strict on
the version of Rubocop.  Wait on being strick
